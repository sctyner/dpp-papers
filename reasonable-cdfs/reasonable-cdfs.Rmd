# Introduction

- Begin with a short discussion about *Likelihood ratio as weight of forensic evidence: a closer look*  
    * Not every CDF in KS bounds is reasonable
    * Range of LRs given, but not a distribution.
    * Within the range, some LRs are going to be more likely than others 
- Moving in a different direction 
    * Don't look at the data first 
    * Use only knowledge about the problem to select range of possible distributions 
    * Define the constraints you wish to place on the distribution of CDFs (or on CDFs themselves?)
    * Use Dirichlet Process priors to get a range of plausible values
- Specific application(s)
    * Come up with range of plausible LRs for RI values in glass data:
        * What is the distribution of RI in glass from the same pane? 
        * What is the distribution of RI in all glass from the relevant population? 
    * (Maybe) Range of plausible SLRs for RF scores for element concentrations in glass data
        * What is the distribution of scores for known mates? 
        * What is the distribution of scores for known non-mates? 

# Dirichlet Process Priors

- Motivation: 
    * Bayesian way
    * Know very little about the shape, family, etc of the distribution
    * Simulate random CDFs from many priors
    * Check that they fit a set of constraints
    * Obtain posterior distribution of CDFs to get interval of plausible values of interest
- Theory: 
    * A little bit about what Dirichlet Process Priors are 
    * Not too technical for a forensic science audience
    * Stick breaking procedure
    * Size of M dictates how much to weigh data vs. base measure in the posterior 
    * Posterior: pick a random data point or pick a random value from the base measure 
- Application: 
    * Computer simulation: pick many Ms, base distributions, bounds/constraints.
    * Approximation 
    * Mention the `dprocsim` package 

# Simulation study 

## Likelihood ratio for RI data 

Two distributions, (1) RI for glass from the same pane, (2) RI for glass from different panes

- What is previously known about glass data from Lindley paper and others? 

- Bounds on CDF: smoothed 80% and 95% KS bands
